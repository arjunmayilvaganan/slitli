# Slitli
The Bruce Lee of Slitting your Long URL's short.

Slitli is a light weight URL Shortener service based on [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/), A [Python](https://www.python.org) framework, and [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org).

## Disclaimer
This was written in 2015, so I can learn web service development & deployment (Heroku, and now Render), python, postgres, CSS (centering a div ðŸ˜‚), Bootstrap, templating engines and more.

This is by no means a production-ready application and was not intended for production. This has a large number of flaws that I'm well aware of.

I even used to own the domain slit.li, but I gave up the ownership years ago. It was fun while I still owned such a short domain and had fun naming it so, but it doesn't make sense to keep running your own URL shortener at a cost, does it? At least I haven't personally used one in ages.
